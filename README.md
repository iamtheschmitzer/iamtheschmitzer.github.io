Engineering Highlights

## Parametric Composite Knowledge System
**Problem**: Expense and time of engineering buildable composite airplane parts given a finite element model.

**Solution**: Wrote Parametric Composite Knowledge System to build 3D composite ply model automatically.

**Result**: Awarded US Patents #[59,984,511](https://ppubs.uspto.gov/api/pdf/downloadPdf/5984511?requestToken=eyJzdWIiOiJkMWQ4NTk2Yi1iZTNiLTRhYWMtYmY5MS02ODRjMTE4Y2E4ODMiLCJ2ZXIiOiI3MTNhMzE2ZC05NzIyLTQwZTMtOGIzYy1iMTYzZWUwN2I1ZDQiLCJleHAiOjB9) and [6,341,261](https://ppubs.uspto.gov/api/pdf/downloadPdf/6341261?requestToken=eyJzdWIiOiJkMWQ4NTk2Yi1iZTNiLTRhYWMtYmY5MS02ODRjMTE4Y2E4ODMiLCJ2ZXIiOiJmYTM5YTdlZC0wNzBmLTRlNmYtOTk1YS03M2Y3ODg0YzE3OTciLCJleHAiOjB9) which were later sold to Unigraphics.

## HotDog Single-Index Database
**Problem**: Need for in-memory multi-process database proved too expensive.

**Solution**: Wrote Hot-Dog, a single-index in-memory database allowing concurrent accesses across mutiple clients.

**Result**: Used in multiple company products in trading systems at Bridge Trading Company and central system at Bridge Information Systems, saving $100k per installation.

## Market Data Analyics System
**Problem**: Multiple dated interactive Analytics systems with little reuse needed technology refresh.

**Solution**: Designed Interactive Analytics System with generic query layer, configured using declarative syntax to promote reuse across numerous contexts.

**Result**: Used in company terminals for interactive analytic screens, charts, index calculation, database and web access.
