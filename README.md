# Jeff Schmitz Engineering Highlights

## Parametric Composite Knowledge System
A 3-D design tool for composite aircraft parts

**Problem**: Expense and time of engineering buildable composite airplane parts given a finite element model.

**Solution**: Wrote Parametric Composite Knowledge System to build 3D composite ply model automatically.

**Result**: Awarded US Patents which were later sold to Unigraphics.  See patent #[59,984,511](https://ppubs.uspto.gov/api/pdf/downloadPdf/5984511?requestToken=eyJzdWIiOiJkMWQ4NTk2Yi1iZTNiLTRhYWMtYmY5MS02ODRjMTE4Y2E4ODMiLCJ2ZXIiOiI3MTNhMzE2ZC05NzIyLTQwZTMtOGIzYy1iMTYzZWUwN2I1ZDQiLCJleHAiOjB9) and [6,341,261](https://ppubs.uspto.gov/api/pdf/downloadPdf/6341261?requestToken=eyJzdWIiOiJkMWQ4NTk2Yi1iZTNiLTRhYWMtYmY5MS02ODRjMTE4Y2E4ODMiLCJ2ZXIiOiJmYTM5YTdlZC0wNzBmLTRlNmYtOTk1YS03M2Y3ODg0YzE3OTciLCJleHAiOjB9) 

## HotDog Database
A Single-Index in-memory database

**Problem**: Vendor-provided in-memory multi-process database proved too expensive.

**Solution**: Wrote Hot-Dog, a single-index in-memory database allowing concurrent accesses across mutiple clients.

**Result**: Used in multiple company products in trading systems at Bridge Trading Company and central system at Bridge Information Systems, saving $100k per installation.

## Market Data Analyics System
Generic system for interactive analytics

**Problem**: Multiple dated interactive Analytics systems with little reuse needed technology refresh.

**Solution**: Designed Interactive Analytics System with generic query layer, configured using declarative syntax to promote reuse across numerous contexts.

**Result**: Used in company terminals for interactive analytic screens, charts, index calculation, database and web access.

## BSLT Language
Declarative language for manipulating binary data

**Problem**: Languages like XSLT require XML format, and data can need manipulation prior to serializing 

**Solution**: Designed language for binary transformations

**Result**: Significant reduction in errors in producing analytics screens

## OpenDDS Safety Profile
Memory manager that eliminates runtime heap allocations.

**Problem**: Dynamic Allocations at runtime deemed unsafe for DoD use cases.

**Solution**: Wrote memory manager for OpenDDS making all allocations at startup as part of [OpenDDS Safety Profile](https://opendds.readthedocs.io/en/master/devguide/safety_profile.html).

**Result**: Approved for use in DoD applications.

## Liquibook
Ultra fast order-matching system, popular with Crypto exchanges

**Problem**: Financial clients need a simulated market to test trading algorithms

**Solution**: Built open-source order-matching system.

**Result**: Clients able to quickly test trading algorithms.  Used in production by Crypto exchanges due to its speed.

## MIPS Accelerartor
Batch healthcare analytics system for quality metrics

**Problem**: CMS quality metrics are respecified annually, making direct coding of SQL queries expensive ro maintain.

**Solution**: Built an interpreter for the Clinical Query language for quality metric evaluation, and incorporated into analytics system.

**Result**: Grew company from early startup days to successful exit
